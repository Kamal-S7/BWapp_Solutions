BWapp : Robots File Vulnerability Solution by KAMAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to challenge
robots.txt page generally contains allowed/disallowed directory and file names
Here disallowed names are - 
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /documents/
Disallow: /images/
Disallow: /passwords/

It seems admin or password directory is sensitive and lets try to access these pages
Admin portal is accessible - http://localhost/BWapp/bWAPP/admin/
We have found credentials in the admin portal page
Now try to access password page
Password page is also accessible and valid passwords found

Note: Presence of robots.txt file is not a vulnerability. If this page contains any sensitive directory/file name and if its accessible which can lead to sensitive data disclosure, then we can consider it as an issue
Challenge Solved..

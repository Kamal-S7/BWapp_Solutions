BWapp : HTML Injection - Stored (Blog) Vulnerability Solution by KAMAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to challenge
In stored case, provided payload will be stored permanently in the application database
When any user visits the page, then that payload will be executed
lets provide a payload for XSS using img tag - <img src="ks" onmouseover=alert('XSS')>
We can notice, an image icon is created
Now go to some different page and re-visit the stored blog page again
image icon is stored
Now check if XSS payload executes successfully
Challenge Solved.
